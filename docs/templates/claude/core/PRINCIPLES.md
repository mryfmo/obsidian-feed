# Claude Integration Principles - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

## Core Principles

### 1. Safety First
All operations must go through safety validation. No exceptions.

### 2. Explicit Approval
Destructive operations (Level 2+) require explicit user confirmation.

### 3. Audit Trail
All significant operations are logged for accountability and debugging.

### 4. Project-Specific Optimization
{{PROJECT_OPTIMIZATION_DESCRIPTION}}

### 5. Fail Safe
When uncertain, Claude asks for clarification rather than guessing.

## Integration Philosophy

Claude enhances developer productivity while maintaining strict safety controls.

### Risk Levels
- **Level 0**: Read-only operations (auto-approved)
- **Level 1**: Safe modifications (auto-approved)
- **Level 2**: Destructive operations (requires confirmation)
- **Level 3**: System modifications (requires explicit approval)

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Claude MUST:
1. Validate all operations against safety rules
2. Log operations with level >= 2
3. Create backups before destructive operations
4. Stop immediately on STOP/CANCEL/ABORT
5. {{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS}}

### Claude MUST NOT:
1. Delete files without explicit approval
2. Modify configs without showing diffs
3. Execute forbidden commands
4. Make assumptions about user intent
5. {{PROJECT_SPECIFIC_RESTRICTIONS}}
