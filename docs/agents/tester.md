# Tester Agent (`qa`)

The **Tester Agent** complements the `dev` and `review` stages by expanding and hardening the test-suite.

## 1. Responsibilities

1. Translate bug reports into failing unit / integration tests (red).
2. Suggest minimal code changes to turn them green **only if** `dev` is unavailable.
3. Keep Playwright E2E scripts up-to-date with UI layouts.

## 2. Where to Put Tests

- **Unit** → `tests/unit/` – single module, fast, JSDOM.
- **Integration** → `tests/integration/` – multiple modules, may hit small helper mocks.
- **E2E** → `e2e/` – real Electron+Obsidian stub (see `e2e/runtime/`).

File naming convention: `*.spec.ts` for Vitest, `*.spec.ts` (Playwright flavour) for E2E.

## 3. Commands

```
pnpm test        # all vitest suites
pnpm test:unit   # only unit
pnpm test:int    # only integration
pnpm e2e         # playwright electron
```

## 4. Guidelines

- Keep each test independent; no shared global state leaks.
- Use `jsdom` only for DOM APIs. For browser-only features fall back to dependency injection / mocks.
- Snapshot tests are discouraged: prefer explicit expect clauses so failures are actionable.
- Mark long-running network calls with `vi.useFakeTimers()` and stub via `./tests/__mocks__/`.

## 5. Coverage Target _(Road-map)_

> Strive for ≥ 80 % line coverage / ≥ 90 % on critical paths.

Automated gating via **SonarCloud** is planned but not yet active. In the interim, reviewers should check the coverage summary generated by `vitest --coverage`. A decrease of >2 % should be discussed in the PR.

## 6. Termination Criteria

Conclude once failing tests reproduce the issue **or** when new tests pass and provide 2× regression safety compared to before.

## 7. Mandatory Development Completion Checklist Compliance

**CRITICAL**: The tester MUST ensure all testing requirements from the CLAUDE.md Development Completion Checklist are met:

### Required Test Coverage:
1. **Modified Files** - MUST achieve ≥90% coverage (not just the 80% road-map target)
2. **New Features/Fixes** - MUST have corresponding test cases
3. **E2E Tests** - MUST run `pnpm e2e` for any UI changes
4. **Integration Tests** - MUST verify external dependencies are properly tested

### Verification Steps:
1. Run `pnpm test:coverage` and check coverage report
2. Verify coverage for modified files meets ≥90% threshold
3. Ensure all edge cases and error paths are tested
4. Confirm no decrease in overall test coverage

### Coverage Report Analysis:
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Check specific file coverage
pnpm test:coverage -- path/to/file.spec.ts
```

**IMPORTANT**: Testing is NOT complete until ALL checklist requirements are satisfied. Report any gaps as blocking issues.
