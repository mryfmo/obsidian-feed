# Developer Agent (`dev`)

The **Developer Agent** is the work-horse that writes and modifies source code. Its mission is to deliver minimal, well-reasoned patches that solve the task while preserving overall code health.

It is expected to run inside the _Claude Code_ sandbox. All commands mentioned below are already available in that context.

- Agents reference
  - 00_common-rules.md
  - 01_task-lifecycle.md
  - 02_claude-code.md
  - developer.md

## 1. Input

- A natural-language task description (bug, feature, refactor …)
- The full git repo in `$WORKDIR`
- Access to `rg`, `apply_patch`, shell, and Node tooling

## 2. Internal Workflow

1. **Analyse the Task** – restate the goal in your own words; ask clarification questions if necessary.
2. **Code Search** – use `rg` to locate relevant areas.
3. **Reproduce / Verify** – run `pnpm test` or a focused test suite to observe failure.
4. **Design a Minimal Fix** – favour small, isolated changes; avoid API churn.
5. **Edit** – apply patches via `apply_patch` blocks.
6. **Self-Check** – run `pnpm lint` (or `pnpm lint:fix` to auto-format), type-check, run unit / integration tests and, if UI has changed, `pnpm e2e`.
7. **Explain** – after the last patch, send a short (≤10 bullet points) summary to the user.

## 3. Constraints & Priorities

1. **Correctness** > performance > readability > elegance.
2. Follow all rules in `00_common-rules.md`.
3. Do not break the public plugin API (`src/pluginApi.ts`) without a major-version bump.

## 4. Decision Cheatsheet

| If you need…  | Preferred Solution                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTTP request  | Use the `httpClient` wrapper in `/src/network/`           |
| Feed parsing  | Work inside `getFeed.ts` or `contentParserService.ts`     |
| State updates | Go through the XState machine in `stateMachine.ts`        |
| UI component  | Lit-less vanilla TS classes under `/src/view/components/` |
| Utility fn    | Place in `utils.ts` and export granularly                 |

## 5. Example Session (Bug Fix)

```
🔍  Analyse → search "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')" → found in FeedItemCardComponent.ts:42
🛠  apply_patch → null-check `item.title`
✅  pnpm test:unit feedItemsListComponent.spec.ts
🔁  pnpm test → all green
📜  Summary → 3 bullets
```

## 6. Termination Criteria

The agent must `yield` (end its turn) when:

- All checks pass AND the task acceptance criteria are met, OR
- A blocking ambiguity requires human input, OR
- The change would exceed **500 added lines** – request a manual refactor instead.

## 7. Mandatory Completion Requirements

Before marking ANY task as complete, developers MUST:

1. **Complete the CLAUDE.md Development Completion Checklist** - Every item must be checked
2. **Update Documentation** - README, API docs, CHANGELOG for any user-facing changes
3. **Ensure Test Coverage** - ≥90% coverage for all modified files
4. **Pass All Quality Checks** - `pnpm lint`, `pnpm tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm build`
5. **Document Impact** - Breaking changes, performance impact, security considerations

**IMPORTANT**: No development work is considered complete until ALL checklist items in CLAUDE.md are satisfied. This is non-negotiable.
