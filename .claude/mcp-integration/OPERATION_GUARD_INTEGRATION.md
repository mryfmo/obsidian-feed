# OperationGuard Integration Summary

## Overview

The OperationGuard has been successfully integrated into the MCP system to provide security and audit capabilities for all file system operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **MCPIntegration Class Updates**

- Added `private operationGuard: OperationGuard` member
- Initialized in constructor after the analyzer
- Created interceptor methods for all file operations

### 2. **New Methods Added**

#### File Operations with Guard Protection:

- `readFile(filePath: string)` - Read files with permission checks
- `writeFile(filePath: string, content: string, reason?: string)` - Write with validation
- `deleteFile(filePath: string, reason: string)` - Delete with mandatory reason
- `modifyFile(filePath: string, content: string, reason: string)` - Modify existing files
- `executeCommand(command: string, args: string[], reason?: string)` - Execute commands safely
- `checkOperationPermission(operation: string, target: string, context?)` - Check permissions without executing

### 3. **Security Features**

#### Automatic Blocking:
- Deletion of critical files (*.md, package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore)
- Deletion of protected directories (.git, .github, node_modules, src, docs)
- Dangerous commands (rm -rf /, git push --force, npm/yarn/pnpm publish)

#### Confirmation Required:
- All delete operations (Level 2)
- Config file modifications (Level 3)
- Dangerous commands (git clean, git reset --hard)

#### Audit Trail:
- All operations are logged to `.claude/audit.log`
- Includes timestamp, operation, target, status, user, and security level
- Log format: JSON entries, one per line

### 4. **Integration Points**

The OperationGuard is now integrated at these points:

1. **Constructor** - Initialized when MCPIntegration is created
2. **Validate Method** - Checks read permissions before validation
3. **File Operation Methods** - All new methods use the guard
4. **Audit Logging** - Automatic logging of all operations

### 5. **Usage Example**

```typescript
const integration = new MCPIntegration(mcpClients);

// Check permission without executing
const check = await integration.checkOperationPermission('delete', 'README.md');
// Result: { allowed: false, level: 99, message: "Operation forbidden..." }

// Read file (allowed)
const content = await integration.readFile('/path/to/file.txt');

// Delete file (requires confirmation)
try {
  await integration.deleteFile('/tmp/temp.txt', 'cleanup');
} catch (error) {
  // Error: Operation requires confirmation...
}

// Modify config file (requires confirmation and backup)
try {
  await integration.modifyFile('package.json', newContent, 'update version');
} catch (error) {
  // Error: Operation requires confirmation...
}
```

### 6. **Security Levels**

- **Level 0**: Read operations (always allowed)
- **Level 1**: Create/basic operations (auto-approved)
- **Level 2**: Delete operations (requires confirmation)
- **Level 3**: Config file modifications (requires confirmation + backup)
- **Level 99**: Forbidden operations (always blocked)

### 7. **Configuration**

Rules are defined in `claude-rules.json` at the project root:
- Forbidden patterns for different operations
- Commands requiring confirmation
- Audit and rollback settings
- Behavioral rules

### 8. **Testing**

A demo script is provided at `.mcp/demo-operation-guard.ts` that demonstrates:
- Permission checking for various operations
- Actual file operations with guard protection
- Audit log inspection

Run with: `cd .mcp && npx tsx demo-operation-guard.ts`

## Next Steps

To fully integrate with actual MCP clients:

1. Implement proper MCP filesystem client methods (write_file, delete_file, etc.)
2. Add user confirmation prompts for operations requiring approval
3. Implement backup functionality for config file modifications
4. Add rollback registry functionality
5. Integrate with TODO system for tracking destructive operations

## Dependencies Added

- `turndown`: For HTML to Markdown conversion in fetcher
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP SDK for integration
- `axios`: HTTP client (moved from dependencies to devDependencies)
